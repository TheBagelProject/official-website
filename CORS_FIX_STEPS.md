# CORS Issue Fixed - Next Steps

## ✅ Issue Identified: CORS Policy Blocking Request

The error shows that your Google Apps Script is blocking cross-origin requests. This is completely normal for Google Apps Script.

## ✅ Fixed in Code

I've updated your WaitlistForm.js to use `mode: 'no-cors'` which is the proper way to handle Google Apps Script requests from web browsers.

## ✅ Updated Environment Variable

Updated your .env file to use the correct Google Apps Script URL:
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby-alwo5oDtvugIQ8g2LTNh5NUsl35nN-_JFuFpJLiOJzT8tca4XczBMcpZ-GnUmYnj/exec
```

## 🔧 Important: Restart Your Development Server

Since we changed the .env file, you MUST restart your development server:

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm start
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **Restart your dev server** (this is critical!)
2. **Submit the form** again
3. **Check browser console** - should show "Request sent with no-cors mode"
4. **Check Google Sheets** - verify data appears
5. **Check your email** - welcome message should arrive

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### Method 1: Check Google Sheets
- Open your Google Sheet
- Submit form
- New row should appear with your data

### Method 2: Check Google Apps Script Logs
- Go to Google Apps Script → Executions
- Should see new execution when form is submitted
- Check logs for email sending confirmation

### Method 3: Check Email
- Submit form with your email
- Check inbox (and spam folder)
- Welcome email should arrive

## 🚨 If Still No Email After Restart

If data appears in Google Sheets but no email arrives:

1. **Check Gmail API** in Google Apps Script:
   - Services → Gmail API → Make sure it's added
   
2. **Run test email function** in Apps Script:
   ```javascript
   function testWelcomeEmail() {
     try {
       sendWelcomeEmail('your-email@example.com', 'Test User');
       console.log('Test email sent successfully!');
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Test email failed:', error.toString());
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Check Apps Script permissions**:
   - You may need to reauthorize the script
   - Run the test function and grant permissions when prompted

## 📝 Expected Console Output After Fix

After restart, you should see:
```
🔧 Debug - Google Sheets URL: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby-alwo5oDtvugIQ8g2LTNh5NUsl35nN-_JFuFpJLiOJzT8tca4XczBMcpZ-GnUmYnj/exec
🚀 Sending data to Google Sheets: [your data]
📡 Using URL: [correct URL]
📨 Request sent with no-cors mode
📨 Note: Cannot read response due to CORS restrictions, but request should be processed
```

No CORS errors should appear!
